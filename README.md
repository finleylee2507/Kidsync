## About The Project

![Kidsync Landing Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61121081/224862444-9d3269a0-5106-4164-831b-6cbbdd89b276.jpeg)

Kidsync is an information sharing app that bridges the communication gap between co-parents, caretakers, and babysitters
to ensure that all parties have the most complete information about their children at all times.

As a parent, Kidsync enables you to:

- Stay updated about changes to your child’s schedule in real-time.
- Enable your friends and family to care for your children with all the information they will need upfront.
- If in an emergency, have all of the information easily accessible for emergency professionals to administer the best
  care.
- Spend less time searching and making duplicates of documents like insurance cards, vaccination records, etc.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Demo

Check out our app in action at: https://yourturn-bb7ce.web.app!

To explore the app, you can sign in with your own Google account (we plan to add support for more sign-in methods in the
future).

Alternatively, you can watch a quick video demo of the app below.

(demo video coming soon...)

Note that this app was developed in a short timeframe of 3 weeks and may still contain some bugs. If you encounter any
issues, please feel free to report them in the Issues section of our GitHub repository.

## Getting Started

The following section outlines the steps for building and running KidSync. Firstly, clone the repository to your local
directory.

### Prerequisites

It is important to note that this project requires Node Package Manager (npm) to be installed on your system. If you do
not have it installed, you can follow the following commands:

- To download the latest version of npm, on the command line, run the following command
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

- To see if you already have Node.js and npm installed and check the installed version, run the following commands:
  ```sh
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

Refer to this link for detailed installation
instructions: <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">Downloading and installing
Node.js and npm</a>.

After installing Node.js and Npm, you need to set up a firbase account following this
tutorial: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/client/get-firebase">Getting started with Firebase</a>

* Log into your Firebase Account on the command line
  ```
  firebase login
  ```

* Now that you’re logged in, you will need to initialize Firebase in your React app
  ```
  firebase init
  ```

For help configuring Firebase, check out this useful
tutorial: <a href="[https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/client/get-firebase](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-deploy-a-react-app-with-firebase-hosting-98063c5bf425)">
How to Deploy a React App with Firebase Hosting
</a>

Once you have npm and firebase CLI installed, you can start running the project.

### Run

To run the project, execute the following command:

- npm
  ```sh
  npm run
  ```

Upon running the command, you will be prompted with a localhost URL, which can be opened in any browser to access the
project.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

After creating an account, users can enter their dependent's information by clicking on the 'Add Dependent' button.

After creating their dependent, users can share access to their dependent's information with another account. They can
select which sections of information will be available to the caretaker.

Caretakers can view their dependent's information in the app and select when the child is physically with them.

When the caretaker is no longer responsible for the dependent, the original caretaker can revoke the caretaker's access
to the information.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add support for sharing information to caretakers without account
- [ ] Add automated limited-time access to information for caretakers
- [ ] Add task list for caretakers to check off items
